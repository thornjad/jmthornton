						  Artisanal SSH socket remapping
					  </blockquote>

					  <p>I spend a lot of my development time working on a remote server,
					    and regularly need to connect to a number of additional servers, all
					    over SSH. Plus I often push and pull git-controlled code via SSH to
					    yet more remote servers.</p>

					  <p>To keep track of everything, I do 100% of my work within <a
					                                                                href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux">tmux</a>. To let me chain my SSH
					    connections, nearly every connection uses <code>ForwardAgent</code>.
					    Unfortunately, this doesn't work for long. When I reconnect to a
					    server and reattach my tmux session, I am suddenly unable to chain my
					    connections!</p>

					  <p>The problem here is that my SSH Agent has created a new socket for
					    my new connection. This works fine by itself, but when I reattach the
					    <em>already existing</em> tmux session, I no longer have any reference
					    to the new socket. Inside of tmux, SSH will try to use the socket in
					    use at the time the session was created, which probably no longer
					    exists.</p>

					  <p>So what to do? The obvious solution is to simply close my tmux
					    session when I disconnect and create a new one with every new
					    connection. But this has problems.
						  <ul>
							  <li>First, what if I <em>accidentally</em> disconnect? Maybe I've
							    lost my network connection, or somehow accidentally hit
							    <code>~.</code>. I want to get back into my session as quickly and
							    easily as possible.</li>
							  <li>Second, what if I want to save my panes when I disconnect?
							    Maybe there's some long-running process I want to keep. Or maybe I
							    simply don't want to have to recreate my session every time I
							    connect (though some of this can be solved by a project like <a
							                                                                   href="https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator">tmuxinator</a>).</li>
						  </ul>
					  </p>

					  <p>Obviously, a better solution would be to just fix the problem and
					    get tmux to always use the current socket. Additionally, I want to be
					    sure to support using tmux within SSH within tmux, chained
					    arbitrarily. The answer is to always put the socket in a known
					    location and hook everything up to use it.</p>

					  <p>Rather than try to devise some solution to signal to tmux what the
					    current socket file is, it will be much easier to use a symbolic link.
					    Whenever we create a new socket, we'll simply override the existing
					    link with a link to the new socket.</p>

					  <p>We need a name for this symbolic socket, so how about
					    <code>/tmp/ssh-agent-$USER-screen</code>. We're putting it in
					    <code>/tmp/</code> since it doesn't matter too much if this is
					    overwritten or cleaned up. We're also using the <code>USER</code>
					    environment variable to keep sockets separate for different users. At
					    the end, I'm putting <code>-screen</code> since this is sort-of more
					    general than <code>-tmux</code>, but it can really be whatever, or
					    even removed.</p>

					  <p>Now, creating a symbolic link is all fine and good, but what do we
					    actually link to? Unfortunately there's no great built-in way to grab
					    the current socket all the time. But there's no need to re-invent the
					    wheel, we can use the proven <a
					                                   href="https://github.com/wwalker/ssh-find-agent">ssh-find-agent</a>
					    tool. So let's put that in a useful location:</p>

					  <pre lang="bash"><code>git clone git@github.com:wwalker/ssh-find-agent.git ~/lib/ssh-find-agent</code></pre>

					  <p>We'll use the "automatic" <code>-a</code> option, which will find
					    the active SSH agent and store it in <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> for
					    us. But, if there is no active SSH session, nothing useful will
					    happen, so we'll want to get the SSH agent started.</p>

					  <pre lang="bash"><code># Source the script first
. ~/lib/ssh-find-agent/ssh-find-agent.sh
ssh_find_agent -a

# If nothing happened, we need to start up the ssh-agent
if [ -z "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ]
then
  eval $(ssh-agent) > /dev/null
  ssh-add -l >/dev/null || alias ssh='ssh-add -l >/dev/null || ssh-add && unalias ssh; ssh'
fi</code></pre>

					  <p>Now that we have the socket, we just need to make (or override)
					    that symbolic link so it can be found later.</p>

					  <pre lang="bash"><code>SOCK="/tmp/ssh-agent-$USER-screen"
if test $SSH_AUTH_SOCK && [ $SSH_AUTH_SOCK != $SOCK ]
then
  rm -f /tmp/ssh-agent-$USER-screen
  ln -sf $SSH_AUTH_SOCK $SOCK
  export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$SOCK
fi</code></pre>

					  <p>Putting it all together, we'll find the active socket or create it,
					    then make a known symblic link. Now we just have to do this everywhere
					    the socket is needed. This is the most annoying part, though it can be
					    relieved with a tool like <a
					                                href="https://github.com/danrabinowitz/sshrc">sshrc</a>. The full
					    process will need to be added to the <code>~/.bashrc</code> or
					    <code>~/.zshrc</code> on your host system, as well as every system you
					    want to chain tmux and SSH sessions from.</p>

					  <p>To be clear about where this needs to happen, if your chain looks like this:</p>

					  <pre>host &rarr; tmux &rarr; (remote 1) &rarr; tmux &rarr; (remote 2) &rarr; tmux &rarr; (remote 3)
            â†˜
              (remote 4) &rarr; tmux &rarr; (remote 5)</pre>

					  <p>Then you would need to have this set-up on <code>host</code>,
					    <code>(remote 1)</code>, <code>(remote 2)</code> and <code>(remote
					4)</code>, but not the last two remotes. If you think of these chain
					    connections as a tree, the socket mapping is not needed on the leaves.
					    Technically it's also not needed on any nodes on which you're not
					    using tmux, provided you use <code>ForwardAgent</code>.</p>

					  <p>So there we have it, the SSH socket symbolically linked to a known location. After cloning ssh-find-agent, here's the complete script to add to your shell login script as required:</p>

					  <pre lang="~/.bashrc"><code># Known SSH Socket for tmux
# https://blog.jmthornton.net/p/tmux-known-socket

. ~/lib/ssh-find-agent/ssh-find-agent.sh
ssh_find_agent -a
if [ -z "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ]
then
  eval $(ssh-agent) > /dev/null
  ssh-add -l >/dev/null || alias ssh='ssh-add -l >/dev/null || ssh-add && unalias ssh; ssh'
fi

# Predictable SSH authentication socket location so tmux can find it
SOCK="/tmp/ssh-agent-$USER-screen"
if test $SSH_AUTH_SOCK && [ $SSH_AUTH_SOCK != $SOCK ]
then
  rm -f /tmp/ssh-agent-$USER-screen
  ln -sf $SSH_AUTH_SOCK $SOCK
  export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$SOCK
fi</code></pre>
