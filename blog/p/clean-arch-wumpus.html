            <p>
              Chapter 26 is a short section of Uncle Bob Martin&#39;s classic, Clean Architecture. It
              discusses the necessary evil of creating a <code class="language-java">Main</code> component
              which handles the dirty work and initializes the rest of the program. This component necessarily
              breaks rules to get the show running and provide an interface with the non-clean world which is
              our reality. The <code class="language-java">Main</code> component takes care of setting up
              globals and may enter the program into an infinite loop to keep it running forever.
            </p>

            <p>
              Uncle Bob gives a lengthy yet incomplete example of a
              <code class="language-java">Main</code> class component for a hypothetical game of &quot;Hunt
              the Wumpus&quot;. The game is a text-based somewhat-roguelite dungeon-crawler in which you seek
              out the Wumpus and avoid traps. A simple game concept, well within the wheelhouse of a
              first-year computer science student, and Uncle Bob&#39;s code looks the part. For an otherwise
              insightful book about how to separate concerns, Martin seems to give up when it comes to this
              component, relegating it to be &quot;the dirtiest of all the dirty components&quot; without any
              effort to find a better way. The example class he presents is needlessly brittle and repetitive.
            </p>

            <p>
              Here is that entire <code class="language-java">Main</code> class, as presented in the book.
              Note that the book contains the comment at the end (<code class="language-java"
                >much code removed...</code
              >), it wasn&#39;t added here.

            <h2>User command parsing</h2>

            <p>
              Let&#39;s start with the low-hanging fruit: repetitive statements. The
              <code class="language-java">main</code> method contains the primary game loop, which runs
              forever until the user enters <code class="language-java">&quot;q&quot;</code>. Most of this is
              <em>fine</em>, but the long block of <code class="language-java">else if</code>&#39;s are not
              only difficult to read, they&#39;re needlessly inefficient. We must test input against every
              statement in sequence until one turns up true or there are no statements left to test. Further,
              if the user enters a command which matches none of the conditions (necessitating a complete
              run-through of them all), the game executes a &quot;rest&quot; command, declared outside the set
              of conditions, which could easily come back to bite an unsuspecting developer in the future.
            </p>

            <p>
              Whenever there is a set of three or more distinct conditions to test, it&#39;s almost always a
              better bet to use a <code class="language-java">switch</code>,
              <code class="language-java">case</code> or best of all (if the language supports it), pattern
              matching. The game loop cleans up a bit if we use this advice. We can also take advantage of the
              fact that when comparing strings, the <code class="language-java">switch</code> statement acts
              as if we&#39;re calling the <code class="language-java">String.equals</code> method, so as long
              as we convert the command to lower case, it&#39;ll act identically to calling
              <code class="language-java">String.equalsIgnoreCase</code> repeatedly.
            </p>

            <pre lang="java"><code class="language-java">while (true) {
  System.out.println(game.getPlayerCavern());
  System.out.println(&quot;Health: &quot; + hitPoints + &quot; arrows: &quot; + game.getQuiver());
  System.out.println(&quot;&gt;&quot;);

  String command = br.readLine();
  HuntTheWumpus.Command c;
  switch (command.toLowerCase()) {
    case &quot;e&quot;: c = game.makeMoveCommand(EAST);
      break;
    case &quot;w&quot;: c = game.makeMoveCommand(WEST);
      break;
    case &quot;n&quot;: c = game.makeMoveCommand(NORTH);
      break;
    case &quot;s&quot;: c = game.makeMoveCommand(SOUTH);
      break;
    case &quot;se&quot;: c = game.makeShootCommand(EAST);
      break;
    case &quot;sw&quot;: c = game.makeShootCommand(WEST);
      break;
    case &quot;sn&quot;: c = game.makeShootCommand(NORTH);
      break;
    case &quot;ss&quot;: c = game.makeShootCommand(SOUTH);
      break;
    case &quot;q&quot;: return;
    default: c = game.makeRestCommand();
  }
  c.execute();
}</code></pre>

            <p>
              These conditions are now, in my opinion, more readable, and operate in O(1) time. Additionally,
              the command parsing is visually separated from the user output (which is a sort of UI).
            </p>

            <p>
              Rather than making the command matches here, the architecture would benefit even more from
              taking Martin&#39;s advice from his own book, and moving the UI elements to their own component.
              If we wish to implement a more complex UI in the future, even a GUI, only the dedicated
              component will need to change considerably. In the shorter-term, perhaps we&#39;ll want to add
              an explicit <code class="language-java">&quot;i&quot;</code> command which prints this out. It
              would be nice to separate this concern from the &quot;dirty&quot;
              <code class="language-java">Main</code> component.
            </p>

            <p>
              The main game loop could still live in a clean <code class="language-java">main</code> method,
              but we should restrict it to only getting the command and executing it. This leaves the looping
              action at this, the lowest &quot;dirtiest&quot; level, while abstracting away the complications
              of interpreting user input. Here&#39;s how well we clean it up by separating the concerns via
              abstraction:
            </p>

            <pre lang="java"><code class="language-java">while (true) {
  GameUI.displayUserStatus();
  HuntTheWumpus.Command c = GameUI.getUserCommand();
  c.execute();
}</code></pre>

            <h2>Map generation</h2>

            <p>
              The <code class="language-java">createMap</code> method may indeed be at home in the
              <code class="language-java">Main</code> class, but surely we can clean it up. Uncle Bob leaves
              needless repetition in the same method where he used a loop to avoid it.
            </p>

            <p>
              First, let&#39;s look at the cavern connection block, which uses some not-printed method to
              dynamically generate connections between caverns. This isn&#39;t so bad, but a nested loop could
              abstract it a little better, especially if we wanted to change the cavern geometry in the future
              (I&#39;m thinking hexagons, which are the <a href="https://youtu.be/thOifuHs6eY">bestagons</a>).
              We&#39;ll make the further improvement of moving our directions into an enum, which we&#39;ll
              simply call <code class="language-java">Direction</code>.
            </p>

            <pre lang="java"><code class="language-java">for (String cavern : caverns) {
  for (Direction direction : Direction.values()) {
    maybeConnectCavern(cavern, direction);
  }
}</code></pre>

            <p>
              Next, we have a block which spawns the characters, some bats and some pits into presumably
              random unique caverns. Placing the player and the Wumpus are single statements and probably
              always will be, but we don&#39;t need to repeat ourselves thrice for bats and pits each.
              Let&#39;s also rename the <code class="language-java">anyOther</code> method to
              <code class="language-java">anyOtherCavern</code> to reduce ambiguity.
            </p>

            <p>
              Along with populating caverns, our map generation block gives the player a quiver of arrows?
              This has nothing to do with creating the map! Let&#39;s move that to a method called
              <code class="language-java">createPlayer</code>, which we&#39;ll relegate to the &quot;much code
              removed...&quot; section.
            </p>

            <pre lang="java"><code class="language-java">String playerCavern = anyCavern();
game.setPlayerCavern(playerCavern);
game.setWumpusCavern(anyOther(playerCavern));
IntStream.range(0, 3).forEach(() -&gt; game.addBatCavern(anyOtherCavern(playerCavern)));
IntStream.range(0, 3).forEach(() -&gt; game.addPitCavern(anyOtherCavern(playerCavern)));</code></pre>

            <p>
              Using <code class="language-java">IntStream.range</code> is about the closest we can get to a
              proper range loop like Python&#39;s <code class="language-java">for x in range(i, j)</code>, and
              I much prefer it to <code class="language-java">for</code> loops.
            </p>

            <p>
              Why did I leave the bat and pit cavern population loops separated? Because they&#39;re not
              inherently linked, and we may reasonably wish to change the frequency of one without changing
              the other.
            </p>

            <h2>Hard-coded values</h2>

            <p>
              When an application hard-codes values as severely as this example, it&#39;s hard to avoid
              cringing at the looming technical debt. The severity we see here would be perfectly acceptable
              in an early computer science course, but a real-world system would struggle to keep up with
              changing requirements. A simple typo in a string, an additional witty cavern description or the
              substitution of localized languages should not require code changes.
            </p>

            <p>
              Similarly, values such as the initial player HP, the number of arrows in the player&#39;s
              quiver, the seed for the randomly generated number of caverns, and the number of bat and pit
              caverns, all should be configurable with ease. Perhaps we wish to introduce difficulty levels
              which change the balance of these values. Perhaps we find we&#39;ve given the player too much HP
              for a fair fight. We&#39;ll undoubtedly need to balance these values, and so we&#39;ll be better
              off storing them in an configurable but immutable data structure.
            </p>

            <p>
              As detailed in previous chapters of Clean Architecture, the data structure to house these values
              shouldn&#39;t matter to our <code class="language-java">Main</code> component. They could reside
              in a key-value store, a database of any kind, a CSV or TSV, or even a well formatted plain text
              file. As far as this component knows, they&#39;re all just an interface. For our purposes
              we&#39;ll call the interface <code class="language-java">GameConfiguration</code>, which is
              responsible for loading and providing the configured values.
            </p>

            <p>
              Putting all our changes together with the interface-provided configuration, we arrive at a much
              cleaner architecture than Uncle Bob presents.
            </p>

            <p>
              The resulting code is more terse, hardy and generally cleaner. Is some of this overkill for a
              small pet or student project? It probably is, but Uncle Bob presents this as a contrived but
              real-world example in a printed book about code design, and should have taken the time to apply
              his own principles to his examples.
