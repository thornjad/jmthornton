      <p>Critical thinking plays a crucial role in adult life, significantly impacting our ability to experience a productive and positive existence.</p>

      <p><a href="http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/platoscave.html">Plato's allegory of the cave</a> tells the story of prisoners who have been chained inside a dark cave their entire lives, facing a blank wall. They watch shadows projected on the wall by objects passing in front of a fire behind them, and they believe these shadows are the only reality. One prisoner is freed and exposed to the outside world, discovering that the shadows are just a false representation of reality. When he returns to the cave to enlighten the others, they reject his revelations and cling to their limited view.</p>

      <p>The story is easily seen as an allegory for critical thinking triggered by a traumatic event (the removal from the cave), and the rejection of critical thinking by the remaining prisoners. The abruptly removed prisoner struggles for some time to harmonize his new observations with the assumptions he's lived his entire life, and is forced to conclude that the shadows he knew were not all of reality and indeed not truly things in and of themselves. When he returns to the other prisoners, they show an utter lack of critical thinking and judge him on their own terms rather than considering that their own assumptions could contain flaws.</p>

      <p>Hopefully, the removed prisoner learns continued critical thinking from his experience, and uses his newfound doubt in his assumptions and ways of thinking to drive a curiosity into the way the world truly works. Critical thinking is a process, not an outcome, and the prisoner should enjoy extending the "exploration" phase of their thinking.</p>

      <p>For even greater impact, the newly enlightened prisoner could act as a helper and guide to the others, despite their resistance. In the allegory, he tries to share what he has learned, but they reject him and seem to fear his mad ramblings. They even resolve to put to death anyone who tries to leave the small world they understand. They say this despite their chains which bind them to their positions so tightly that they cannot turn their heads, likely incapable of even seeing each other. With compassion, the freed prisoner could resolve to help them regardless, releasing their chains (perhaps one at a time to mitigate the death threat), and helping each to peer deeper into the world. In our non-hypothetical lives, we are often the prisoners, but our chains are not physical, which can ironically make them harder to remove.</p>

      <p>Yet the shackles that hold us to our assumptions, the beliefs of our parents, the traditions of our cultures, they aren't really there holding us down. Sometimes these chains are more easily released with the help of someone who can show us that our framework of interpreting the world can and should be questioned. By looking inward and recognizing that our perceptions are transient, we open ourselves to limitless potential. Seeing beyond our preconceptions and worldviews, we can begin to understand that our certainties rest on shifting sands. Just as the freed prisoner learned, beliefs that once seemed concrete can dissolve upon careful examination. The approach of critical thinking can help us cultivate a fresh perspective, one that continuously adapts and grows, finding real freedom in questioning and doubting and re-evaluating of our reality.</p>
