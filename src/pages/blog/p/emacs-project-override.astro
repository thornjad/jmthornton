        I've recently been experimenting with replacing
        <a href="https://projectile.mx/">Projectile</a> with the built-in <code>project.el</code>, and
        so far it has impressed me. Not only are all of Projectile's useful features available, but for
        me
        <code>project.el</code>
        runs significantly faster in large repositories. If you're not familiar, both of these packages
        provide functions to search and operate on files and directories in the same project. If you're
        using Git, a "project" is probably synonymous with a repository.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, project detection is not always as easy as looking for a
        <code>.git/</code> nearby, and sometimes Emacs gets it wrong. Projectile solves this by also
        looking for a <code>.projectile</code> file, which overrides detection and says "this is the
        project root". This happens to be one of the features missing in <code>project.el</code>.
      </p>

      <h3>Update</h3>
      <p>Since the writing of this post, Emacs 29 has been released and introduces a variable which may solve this same issue in a cleaner way! Unfortunately it doesn't appear to work for me, but some folks on Reddit commented that it seems to function as expected. So, it may be worth a shot for you: set <code>project-vc-extra-root-markers</code> to a list of file names or glob patterns which mark a project's root in addition to the default ".git", ".hg" and other common markers.</p>
      <p>So, the cleaner equivalent to the rest of the post, if it works, is a simple <pre lang="lisp"><code class="language-lisp">(setq project-vc-extra-root-markers '(&quot;.project.el&quot; &quot;.projectile&quot; ))</code></pre></p>
      <p>If, however, you're like me and can't seem to get this to do anything, the original post still works:</p>
      <hr />
      <h3>Original post</h3>
      <p>
        Luckily, we can provide our own function to <code>project.el</code> which looks for a file like
        this in the current and parent directories. Even better, the excellent Emacs community has
        already jumped on this, and a splendid solution was
        <a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2021-04-02-emacs-project-override/"
          >provided by Michael Stapelberg</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alas, Michael couldn't have forseen that Emacs would change the project root data format in
        Emacs 29, so the provided function only works in earlier versions. However, adding in forward
        compatibility isn't much trouble. And while we're at it, we can also provide support for anyone
        else moving from Projectile like I am, by allowing <code>.projectile</code> to serve as a
        project root marker alongside Michael's <code>.project.el</code>.
      </p>
      <pre is:raw lang="lisp"><code class="language-lisp">(defun project-root-override (dir)
  "Find DIR's project root by searching for a '.project.el' file.

If this file exists, it marks the project root. For convenient compatibility
with Projectile, '.projectile' is also considered a project root marker.

https://jmthornton.net/blog/p/emacs-project-override"
  (let ((root (or (locate-dominating-file dir ".project.el")
                  (locate-dominating-file dir ".projectile")))
        (backend (ignore-errors (vc-responsible-backend dir))))
    (when root (if (version<= emacs-version "28")
                    (cons 'vc root)
                  (list 'vc backend root)))))

;; Note that we cannot use :hook here because `project-find-functions' doesn't
;; end in "-hook", and we can't use this in :init because it won't be defined
;; yet.
(use-package project
  :config
  (add-hook 'project-find-functions #'project-root-override))</code></pre>
      <p>
        Now we can use <code>touch .project.el</code> in any directory, and <code>project.el</code> with
        recognize it as the project root!
      </p>
      <p>
        By the way, the snippet above makes use of
        <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package">use-package</a> which provides fantastic
        package configuration and loading ability. John Wiegley is currently
        <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package/issues/282"
          >working on adding it into Emacs itself</a
        >, so it shouldn't be long before this code snippet is fully native!
      </p>
      <p>
        One note, in an ideal world, I'd prefer the root marker to be just <code>.project</code> instead
        of <code>.project.el</code>, but this is already widely used by other tools like Eclipse and I'd
        rather not cause conflicts. If you'd like to use this in your own Emacs, obviously you can
        change the function to check for anything you want.
      </p>
      <aside>
        <em>Pro tip:</em> If you'd like to use a project root marker like this, but you don't want other
        developers to have to worry about it (i.e. you don't want to commit it nor add it to the
        <code>.gitignore</code>), you can always add locally-ignored files to
        <code>.git/info/exclude</code>.
