  <section>
    <p>
      <strong>Living</strong> in the Twin Cities, Minnesota, and loving
      year-round access to parks and hiking trails. I'm working on my life
      goal of visiting and hiking every state park in Minnesota, something
      my grandparents achieved when I was young. I'm currently at 9 of 64
      state parks.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Standing</strong> with my Minnesota community against ICE's unethical, unjust actions in my state. Doing what I can to support neighbors and local efforts. <strong>ICE must leave Minnesota now.</strong></p>

    <p>
      <strong>Working</strong> as a Manager of Software Engineering at
      <a href="https://dronedeploy.com">DroneDeploy</a>, leading our Enterprise Growth
      team and loving it. I'm a new manager and still learning, having
      transitioned from a Senior Software Engineer in early 2025. I'm
      learning to use AI tools effectively, seeking to cut out hype as well
      as find the utility it can provide.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Studying</strong> part-time at the
      <a href="https://www.umn.edu">University of Minnesota</a>, working on
      my BS in Multidisciplinary Studies with concentrations in computer
      science and applied business. I'm currently taking classes on AI ethics and human factors in technical writing.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Building</strong> my
      <a href="https://emacs.jmthornton.net">Emacs configuration</a>, with a
      focus right now on building and improving my personal note-taking and
      prioritization system built on org-roam (and maybe I'll make a blog
      post about it at some point).
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Learning</strong> to play the bagpipes, more or less on a
      whim, and it's a lot harder than it looks to actually sound good. I
      haven't played an instrument in at least 7 years before this.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Brewing</strong> my next batch of homemade mead, this one will
      be a nice simple traditional dry mead, using local wildflower honey.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Reading</strong> my way through a backlog of weather-related
      books, currently enjoying
