  <h1>Savings Balance Transfer Calculator</h1>

  <noscript>Sorry, this tool requires Javascript.</noscript>

  <p>This is a very, very simple tool for calculating a transfer required to keep a savings account reconciled with a budgeted amount, optionally taking CDs into effect. This tool is custom-made for my own budgeting system (using <a href="https://ynab.com/referral/?ref=5q8xNua5jL0I0_Of">YNAB</a> [contains referral code]) in which the budget specifies the total amount which should be in savings accounts generally, but is agnostic toward the actual allocation between high-yield savings and CDs. This tool allows me to quickly calculate it all in a customized way, saving a little time versus using a normal calculator, mostly due to all the CDs to add together. It also generates a human-readable summary in the format I use to keep records of why I transferred X amount to my savings account.</p>
