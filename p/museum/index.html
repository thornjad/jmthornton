      <h1>Museum of this website</h1>
      <p>My website has undergone many massive changes, including multiple complete rewrites spanning over a thousand git commits. Here, I pay respect to my journey and mark the path into the future, holding hope that this museum will grow to ever greater heights.</p>
      <p>Please note that these are only snapshots of the past; links are not guaranteed to work and, for the most part, only the home page is preserved. Please, no flash photography.</p>

        <div class="sep-top">
          <h2>Initial public commit <small>explore &rarr;</small></h2>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="Initial website" src="./images/initial.webp" />
          <time datetime="2016-06-07">Jun 7, 2016</time>
          <p>This is the first git commit, and the first version to be publicly open source, continuing work I had started in 2015 (which held a nominally open source license but was not public; it was my first website, it was even more awful than this release). This version was extremely basic, but would serve as the base for a flurry of development as I explored this new (to me) medium of the web. Prior to this release, my website was built in Wordpress (first built in 2012).</p>
          <p>This version is built with Bootstrap CSS and jQuery. The font is Droid Sans.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sep-top">
          <h2>v0.7.1, aka v1 <small>explore &rarr;</small></h2>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="v0.7.1" src="./images/v0.7.1.webp" />
          <time datetime="2016-11-13">Nov 13, 2016</time>
          <p>I never actually tagged a v1, but this is spiritually it. This version is the last before we make it to v2. The soon-to-be familiar logo has taken shape. Fun fact, this logo, which you can still see in my favicon, was inspired by the shapes of some binder clips I was playing with while bored at work. It's not a killer origin story, but such is life.</p>
          <p>Built with Bootstrap and jQuery. The font is Roboto.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sep-top">
          <h2>v2 <small>explore &rarr;</small></h2>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="v2" src="./images/v2.webp" />
          <time datetime="2017-06-23">Jun 23, 2017</time>
          <p>As much as it looks the same as v0.7.1... It is, at least on the surface. Changes were almost entirely internal, as I started moving from pure Bootstrap to a derived framework called Bootswatch. I also worked on automating the release process, minimizing code and other small changes.</p>
          <p>Built with Bootstrap, Bootswatch and jQuery. The font is Rounded.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sep-top">
          <h2>v3 <small>explore &rarr;</small></h2>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="v3" src="./images/v3.webp" />
          <time datetime="2019-01-20">Jan 20, 2019</time>
          <p>The first truly ground-up rewrite, using a new framework (which I helped create), new technologies and a return to the single-page portfolio look. All content above the fold is obliterated by a carefully crafted giant SVG. A golden age for the site.</p>
          <p>Built with Mini.css, Sass, Flow and custom Node tooling. The font is Segoe UI.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sep-top">
          <h2>v4 <small>explore &rarr;</small></h2>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="v4" src="./images/v4.webp" />
          <time datetime="2019-02-15">Feb 15, 2019</time>
          <p>While not a large departure from v3, this version added web tools, tweaked design and put a larger focus on me.</p>
          <p>Built with Mini.css, Sass, Flow and custom Node tooling. The font is Segoe UI.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sep-top">
          <h2>v5 <small>explore &rarr;</small></h2>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="v5" src="./images/v5.webp" />
          <time datetime="2019-08-22">Aug 22, 2019</time>
          <p>The most obvious change is a move to a dark theme, one which I would struggle to keep both interesting and accessible over the course of the series. This version also includes a rewrite to remove the Mini.css framework.</p>
          <p>Built with Sass, custom Node tooling. The font is Helvetica Neue.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sep-top">
          <h2>v6</h2>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="v6, the current design" src="./images/v6.webp" />
          <time datetime="2021-07-12">Jul 12, 2021</time>
          <p>That brings us to the current version, you're looking at v6 right now! This version is the most significant rewrite yet, opting to provide a lightning fast, simple, refreshing introduction to me and my software life.</p>
          <p>Built with Sass and no frameworks of any kind. The primary font is Metro Nova, and code is Victor Mono.</p>
